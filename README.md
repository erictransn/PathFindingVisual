# PathFindingVisual

A web application that displays a grid with a starting node and end node. After choosing and starting an algorithm, the program will display animations starting at the start node to show which nodes the algorithm has reach while searching for the end node. Once the end node is found, the nodes that are part of the shortest path will turn to yellow to show the shortest path between the two nodes.

To change the starting node and end node, change the values of start and end nodes in PathfindingVisualizer.jsx. The value for columns is can be 1-50 while the row value can be  1-20.
